# Operations

## Event example

```json
{
  "id": "retry-policy-2026-09-09",
  "task": "payment retries",
  "actor": "agent/claude-code",
  "at": "2026-09-09T10:00:00Z",
  "kind": "decision",
  "choice": "Retry transient gateway failures three times",
  "rationale": "The gateway documents transient timeout responses.",
  "alternatives": ["Retry indefinitely"],
  "evidence": ["src/payments/gateway.ts:42"]
}
```

Task closure is a separate event. `recorded` means a record was submitted;
`none_declared` means the agent explicitly found no relevant decision and must
include its explanation; `incomplete` represents missing or failed capture.
The health report never treats a successful hook or empty event list as proof
of complete decision capture.

## Historical releases

Commit the wiki first, then use `wikipoke snapshot <label>`. The command retains
Git refs for the selected code commit and current wiki commit and writes a
manifest under `.wikipoke/releases/`. Commit that manifest in the next commit.
Historical external sources remain subject to their own retention/access rules.
